# Internet-Applications
Some of the tasks from the internet application course

## Short descriptions

- **`Simple-React-App`**: A minimal React + Vite demo in `Internet_applications/Simple-React-App/`. Provides a small component structure (header and entry components), demo data, local image assets, and scripts to run the dev server or build static files for deployment.

- **`web_scraper`**: A small web-scraping utility placed in `Internet_applications/web_scraper/`. Contains scripts and notebooks for scraping and parsing web content used during the course. Focuses on basic scraping workflows, data extraction, and saving results for downstream processing.

- **`node-js`**: Still in work. Place in `Internet_applications/node_js/`. Small shopping app.
